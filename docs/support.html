        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>📱 Where is my data stored?</h3>
            <p>All your data is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong> using secure local storage
                (SwiftData). We never send your data to any servers. Your device backups (iTunes/Finder/iCloud
                device backup) will include your app data.</p>
            <p><strong>Privacy First:</strong> We believe in keeping your personal health data local and private. Cloud sync is not planned.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>🗑️ How do I delete my data?</h3>
            <p>You can delete individual check-ins by swiping left in the Timeline view. To delete all data, go to
                <strong>Settings > Delete All Data</strong>. This action is permanent and cannot be undone.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>🏥 Apple Health not syncing?</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Open the <strong>Health</strong> app</li>
                <li>Tap your profile icon (top right)</li>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>🔐 How is my data protected?</h3>
            <p>Your data is protected through multiple layers of security:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device passcode:</strong> iOS secures all app data with your device passcode</li>
                <li><strong>App sandbox:</strong> iOS isolates app data from other apps</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Photos and data are encrypted using iOS Data Protection</li>
                <li><strong>No cloud sync:</strong> Data never leaves your device, eliminating cloud security risks</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

                one. Photos are stored locally and encrypted.</p>
